<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open data division has been engaged with Melbourne City to support greater use of their Open Data library by businesses, researchers, and software developers. MOP delivers an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage Open Data using real-world scenarios which helps Melbourne City achieve one of their key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>
The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company overall to present in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and useful components to display the progress of all 3 projects while outlining their goals. Which aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

### <a name="objectives"></a>Completed Goals & Objectives
Along with moving each of the Chameleon projects forward, closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.

- Document a policy for creating and storing documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. Once created, migrating company documents to GitHub converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future students to take the lead. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students (who are on lead) brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Have multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping.

### <a name="evm"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview
The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations. 

#### Goals & Objectives
The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket: 
- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route. 
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle. 


#### Aims this Trimester
The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited. Furthermore, the team aims to implement policies for shared coding practices to provide future teams with detailed references.

#### Deliverables
- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

#### Completion Summary
The team has created a significant number of user stories, and team members have divided up the user stories into individual tasks. Majority of the team is focusing on the application development while a small portion of the team is focusing on enhancing the current design plans to align them more with the branding guidelines. The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed security review of Firestore database to ensure user details are not compromised.
- Implemented "About" Screen providing an overview of the application.
- Implemented functionality to update the application's version.
- Implemented "Terms and Conditions" Screen.
- Created password reset functionalities allowing users to reset their passwords if required.
- Implemented "User Details Update" Screen that allows users to change their personal details.
- Created a central Documents directory within the GitHub Repository and began adding policy documents in markdown.
- Updated GitHub repo readme to include a linking directory to the new policy documents.

<a name="playground"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Melbourne Open Data</h2>

#### Overview

The City of Melbourne has been an Australian leader in Open Data since 2014. The City of Melbourne initiated this project with Deakin to support greater use of their Open Data by businesses, researchers, and software developers. Open Data is a component of their smart cities' strategy.

#### Goals & Objectives

This project entails the development of an educational platform that showcases the practical applications of Open Data, specifically designed to cater to the needs of various stakeholders, such as industry professionals, government entities, and academic researchers. The primary objective of this project is to leverage the utilisation of the City of Melbourne's Open Data.

The long-term goal is to data useage, facilitating innovative and informed solutions to contemporary challenges across the City of Melbourne council area.

#### Aims this Trimester

The initial main focus is to read the documentation for the new API for the Melbourne Open Data Playground, and systematically work through each published (and yet to be published) notebooks and modify the code so that they will run if downloaded.

The aim for the Data Science team is to create a new set of use cases that fit within the 3 defined key areas of interest from the City Of Melbourne. The team is planning to complete a full set of use cases, and also have enough in the backlog for the next trimester when students will be focussed on InnoFes.

The web team is aiming to further streamline the processes for which the notebooks are published, and working with the design team to optimise the device browsing of our website. As part of the approach to the website, the cyber security team will also be scrutinising all apsects of our public-facing site to look for areas of vunerabilities that will need to be rectified.
The other main focus for the leadership is to document and streamline the way that the project is documented for handover at the end of each trimester.


#### Deliverables

- Update the API on all published notebooks (ready to be published again), and notebooks ready for publishing.
- Implement a human-readable URL
- Identify vulnerabilities in the source code, python code and database then document a roadmap to mitigatethem
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Complete analysis on multiple use cases (ready for publishing)
- Create multiple new use cases, allowing enough in the backlog for the next trimester
- Publish notebooks that are ready to be published
- Cleaner resources for the handover procedures for MOP
- Add more functionality to the website
- Implement some interactivity with JavaScript
- Fix the lingering deisgn / css issues within the website

#### Completion Summary
The Data Science team has successfully completed repointing some of the APIs for the completed use cases ready to be republished, and also developed new use case ideas and started coding them up in jupyter.  The Cyber Security team have found vunerabilities, and are continuously documenting how the various approaches have been approached, as well ashow should be approached for when transferring the team to the other Chameleon projects. The Web Dev team have worked on making the styling for the published use cases match the over all theme, published backlog use cases and have been working on the mobile functionality for the website. The web team and design team have also been liaising for the next steps to integrate the team designs.

The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed repointing some of the published use case APIs.
- Completed defining a series of use cases to be explored by the DS team.
- Presented new use case ideas to the client at the City Of Melbourne.
- The source code has been inspected for vulnerabilities.
- Ports for the website have been scanned (5 open ports).

| **Nathan Graham Clee** | 221255235 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science |  | **Use case Live events and the effect on foot traffic and business (Nathan and Keefe)** This use case analysed foot traffic near locations where live events would occur Marvel stadium, near Flinders Street Station towards the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and nearby clubs with music and comedy clubs. It also Identifies the volume of pedestrian traffic during live events and predicts the forecast for live events in a graph by using examples of events from the past. Our use case observes foot traffic and identifies any large spikes; it then looks at why these spikes occur. Our use case helps find public events that bring in a large foot traffic and we analyse why and when this occurs. Lastly, it looks into how businesses can use this increase in foot traffic to expand their sales. **Personal Achievements** Set up the new APIs, Set up GitHub, Replace the API path, Found a solution to use case, Listed all working foot traffic sensors, Found the closest senor to the MCG, Graphed foot traffic, Found two live events that increased foot traffic, Made a graph to show the spikes on the largest day, Evaluated increase means, Found the closest working sensor to the Marvel stadium, Graphed foot traffic from each day, Looked at the huge spike, Graphed spike to prove it was the game, Found the closest sensors to the live music venues, Decided on the two clubs to use, Graphed the club's foot traffic, Graphed the largest spikes, Found why that days were so popular at that time, Updated code so the graph always shows the same week, Wrote descriptions for all coding blocks, Wrote conclusion to whole use case, Fixed up formatting, Submitted to the company’s GitHub. |

| **Tuan Minh Vu** | 219595908 | Undergrad | Senior | Data Science |  | **Bicycle Traffic New road Impacts - St Kilda Road**. We focused on analyzing and interpreting bike count data for St. Kilda road, Melbourne. This data was crucial to understanding the cycling patterns and habits along this route, informing decisions about infrastructure planning, safety measures, and traffic management. This use case aims at understanding the cycling trends on the St. Kilda road and its implications for infrastructure planning and sustainability. The usage patterns discerned from the data serve to guide decisions on infrastructure development and management, such as the need for bike lane expansion, maintenance scheduling, and safety measures. By analyzing hourly bike count data, peak usage times were identified, which would be crucial for traffic management strategies, such as potentially modifying vehicle lane usage during these peak cycling times to ensure cyclists' safety and smooth traffic flow. |
