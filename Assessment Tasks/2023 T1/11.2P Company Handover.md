<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open data division has been engaged with Melbourne City to support greater use of their Open Data library by businesses, researchers, and software developers. MOP delivers an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage Open Data using real-world scenarios which helps Melbourne City achieve one of their key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>
The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company overall to present in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and useful components to display the progress of all 3 projects while outlining their goals. Which aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

### <a name="objectives"></a>Trimester 1 2023 Goals & Objectives
Along with moving each of the Chameleon projects forward, closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.

- Document a policy for creating and storing documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. Once created, migrating company documents to GitHub converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future students to take the lead. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students (who are on lead) brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Have multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping.

### <a name="evm"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview
The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations. 

#### Goals & Objectives
The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket: 
- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route. 
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle. 


#### Aims this Trimester
The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited. Furthermore, the team aims to implement policies for shared coding practices to provide future teams with detailed references.

#### Deliverables
- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

#### Completion Summary
The team created a significant number of user stories, and team members divided up the user stories into individual tasks. Majority of the team focused on the application development while a small portion of the team focused on enhancing the current design plans to align them more with the EVCFLO branding guidelines. The list below outlines the team's main achievements this trimester:

- Updated the "Map" Screen by populating the EV charging station with real data from an external database.
- Completed security review of Firestore database to ensure user details are not compromised.
- Implemented "About" Screen providing an overview of the application.
- Implemented functionality to update the application's version.
- Implemented "Terms and Conditions" and "Privacy Policy" Screens.
- Created password reset functionalities allowing users to reset their passwords if required.
- Added functionality to delete user account upon request.
- Implemented "User Details Update" Screen that allows users to change their personal details.
- Created a central Documents directory within the GitHub Repository and added policy documents in markdown.
- Updated GitHub repo readme to include a linking directory to the new policy documents. 

#### Showcase Video
Here you can view the showcase video for the Evoleon App project: [Evoleon Showcase.](https://youtu.be/PBy32WonKms)


#### Future Deliverables 
- Convert application to beta mode and host it on play store allowing users to access and test its features to provide feedback.
- Increase communication and cross collaboration between the EVCFLO and Evoleon team to improve upon both projects' work streams such as merging the backend databases together.
- Add functionality to filter the EV charging stations based on amenities available nearby.
- Implement and update user interface code for the application pages based on the new high-fidelity Figma designs created in Trimester 1 2023.
- Expand and add new features and functionalities to the overall Evoleon application.

[GitHub](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP-Code)
<br><br>

#### Goals & Objectives

This project entails the development of an educational platform that showcases the practical applications of Open Data, specifically designed to cater to the needs of various stakeholders, such as industry professionals, government entities, and academic researchers. The primary objective of this project is to leverage the utilisation of the [City of Melbourne's Open Data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/pages/home/).

The long-term goal is to data useage, facilitating innovative and informed solutions to contemporary challenges across the City of Melbourne council area.

#### Aims this Trimester

The initial main focus is to read the documentation for the new API for the Melbourne Open Data Playground, and systematically work through each published (and yet to be published) notebooks and modify the code so that they will run if downloaded.

The aim for the Data Science team is to create a new set of use cases that fit within the 3 defined key areas of interest from the City Of Melbourne. The team is planning to complete a full set of use cases, and also have enough in the backlog for the next trimester when students will be focussed on InnoFes.

The web team is aiming to further streamline the processes for which the notebooks are published, and working with the design team to optimise the device browsing of our website. As part of the approach to the website, the cyber security team will also be scrutinising all apsects of our public-facing site to look for areas of vunerabilities that will need to be rectified.
The other main focus for the leadership is to document and streamline the way that the project is documented for handover at the end of each trimester.


#### Deliverables

- Update the API on all published notebooks (ready to be published again), and notebooks ready for publishing.
- Implement a human-readable URL
- Identify vulnerabilities in the source code, python code and database then document a roadmap to mitigatethem
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Complete analysis on multiple use cases (ready for publishing)
- Create multiple new use cases, allowing enough in the backlog for the next trimester
- Publish notebooks that are ready to be published
- Cleaner resources for the handover procedures for MOP
- Add more functionality to the website
- Implement some interactivity with JavaScript
- Fix the lingering deisgn / css issues within the website

#### Completion Summary
The Data Science team has successfully completed repointing some of the APIs for the completed use cases ready to be republished, and also developed new use case ideas and started coding them up in jupyter.  The Cyber Security team have found vunerabilities, and are continuously documenting how the various approaches have been approached, as well ashow should be approached for when transferring the team to the other Chameleon projects. The Web Dev team have worked on making the styling for the published use cases match the over all theme, published backlog use cases and have been working on the mobile functionality for the website.

The use case I developed and finished **Flexible Return to Office Options** combined co-working spaces with the local business (cafes, bars, restaurants etc.) in conjunction with team journey planning as a means to get groups of workers moving and working throughout the CBD suporting local businesses. |
| **Abhishek Bajaj** | 221034312 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science | Yes | Alongside STEVEN NGUYEN we repointed the New Business Location use case. Repointing the use case required updating to version 2 of the City of Melbourne's API. We then needed to format the dataframe to the same output. This required us filter the dataframe. As well, we needed to form the correct choropleth map which required us to format the geojson in combination with the dataframe. I have also worked on gathering the information to create Company's LinkedIn Page. I have actively took part in group discussions and given my feedback to group work. I have brainstormed with the data science Team for new use case ideas, give my use case idea and provided my feedback on some of my peers' ideas. I also actively took part in Capstone Shadowing Program as a Junior Coordinator and helped the students find information regarding the company and its projects. |
| **Vaibhav Kashyap** | 220641102 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science | Yes | In our use case, our main objective was to compare the progress and development of Melbourne municipality with other major cities in Australia. We initially focused on gathering datasets specifically related to Melbourne, but as we delved deeper into our research, we realized the importance of obtaining relevant datasets for other cities as well. During this project, I had the opportunity to mentor a student in a shadowing program. I introduced the student to our company and provided a comprehensive understanding of how things worked. I also motivated the student to consider joining our data science team while encouraging them to explore other options within Chameleon, such as web development and EV tools. |

| **Keefe Euler Alpay** | 221243463 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science |  | My personal achievements were setting up the introduction to my use case, these includes the scenario, the exploratory data analysis objectives, the goals for this analysis, the strategic benefits for the city of Melbourne and I updated the URL links to the used datasets to reflect the ones we have investigated. I was responsible for all the Folium maps in the use case, and I proofread the entire report, fixing grammatical inconsistencies and spelling mistakes. Outside of my use case, I have contributed to all pages of the MOP_Ideation_T1_2023 Excel sheet, I attended and contributed to the last team meeting with Angie and I practiced using the Folium library on the On-street Parking Bay Sensors dataset. I partnered with Nathan to finish the use case called Live events and the effect on foot traffic and business this trimester. The use case analysed the foot traffic near the MCG, Marvel Stadium, The Comic’s Lounge Comedy Club and The Black Rabbit bar/club. We have analysed and explained the increase in foot traffic using the Pedestrian Counting System datasets found in the City of Melbourne Open Data website. |
| **Nathan Graham Clee** | 221255235 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science |  | **Use case Live events and the effect on foot traffic and business (Nathan and Keefe)** This use case analysed foot traffic near locations where live events would occur Marvel stadium, near Flinders Street Station towards the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and nearby clubs with music and comedy clubs. It also Identifies the volume of pedestrian traffic during live events and predicts the forecast for live events in a graph by using examples of events from the past. Our use case observes foot traffic and identifies any large spikes; it then looks at why these spikes occur. Our use case helps find public events that bring in a large foot traffic and we analyse why and when this occurs. Lastly, it looks into how businesses can use this increase in foot traffic to expand their sales. **Personal Achievements** Set up the new APIs, Set up GitHub, Replace the API path, Found a solution to use case, Listed all working foot traffic sensors, Found the closest senor to the MCG, Graphed foot traffic, Found two live events that increased foot traffic, Made a graph to show the spikes on the largest day, Evaluated increase means, Found the closest working sensor to the Marvel stadium, Graphed foot traffic from each day, Looked at the huge spike, Graphed spike to prove it was the game, Found the closest sensors to the live music venues, Decided on the two clubs to use, Graphed the club's foot traffic, Graphed the largest spikes, Found why that days were so popular at that time, Updated code so the graph always shows the same week, Wrote descriptions for all coding blocks, Wrote conclusion to whole use case, Fixed up formatting, Submitted to the company’s GitHub. |
| **Shanuk Julian Devamulla** | 221159324 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science |  | I focused on reworking the pedestrian traffic use case so that it could accept the latest data from Open Data Melbourne. I rewrote the API functions for sensor locations and the pedestrian counting. I then focused on making sure the rest of the notebook accepted the data without error. A lot of errors cropped up however with a lot of troubleshooting, I was able to complete the work and produce a deliverable for the client. [Trello link](https://trello.com/c/vREIPeyW/205-pedestrian-traffic-analysis-new-api) |
| **Siyu Ai** | 223008124 | Postgrad | Junior | Data Science |  | **UHI Effect Reduction use case** aim to help urban planners in urban greening work, by looking for areas that are more seriously affected by the urban heat island effect in potential roadways, and more intuitively understand the priority of greening when making plans. **Personal Achievements:** Successfully set up a new GitHub playground, Trello for use case, determined the data set needed for the use case, also set up new API, performed data extraction, data cleaning and transformation, and performed data visualization through quantitative scoring. |
| **Steven Nguyen** | 222337088 | Undergrad | Junior | Data Science |  |  **Personal Achievement**. Alongside Abhishek Bajaj we repointed the New Business Location use case. Repointing the use case required updating to version 2 of the City of Melbourne's API. We then needed to format the dataframe to the same output. This required us filter the dataframe. As well, we needed to form the correct choropleth map which required us to format the geojson in combination with the dataframe. As well, I assisted other team members with issues they had during their project when it came to repointing the API. 
| **Adam James Bullivant** | 219274937 | Undergrad | Senior | Data Science |  | Throughout the trimester in the Data Science team, I completed a new use case - **Disability Transport Analysis**. This use case reveals key insights into public transport lines and footpaths around Melbourne, being useful for those with disabilities. The key features involve visualising the public transport lines based on their disability features, and also analysing footpaths based on their gradients (using a linear colour scale). The final case was an interactive map that allows users to visualise key route and mapping data based on disability features. Furthermore, I repointed x2 API's from existing use cases, and finalised my existing use case from Trimester 3 2022 so it is now ready to be published to the website.  |
| **Andrew Tilling** | 220554762 | Postgrad | Senior | Data Science |  | Was an active member of the MOP project throughout the trimester, mentoring students and offering both academic and professional advice, successfully worked on two use cases repointing the APIs to the CoM new platform and actively participated in use case ideation creating new use cases for the team to work on. |
| **Tuan Minh Vu** | 219595908 | Undergrad | Senior | Data Science |  | **Bicycle Traffic New road Impacts - St Kilda Road**.
