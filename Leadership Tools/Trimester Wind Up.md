# Trimester Wind UP

### Version 1.1 - Last updated on the 27th May 2023

The purpose of this document is to provide a central checklist for leadership to kick the trimester off and get everyone organised as efficiently as possible. 

| Week | Action Item | Resources |
|:--:   |:---   |:---   |
| Week 0 | Get in touch with the other project leaders for Chameleon, and start planning the week 1 pitch. Create a private chat where you can initially get started. This will eventually move to Chameleon Leadership, but for now have a separate one. |  |
|  | Contact your **Director**. Book in your weekly catch up, and start getting advice ASAP. This is crucial for a successful trimester. |  |
|  | Each project has a series of videos that you can use to get an idea of what each project is, and what can be achieved in a single trimester. | [Leadership Video folder](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Chameleon2-Chameleon-Leadership/Shared%20Documents/Chameleon-%20Leadership/Trimester%201%202023/Showcase_videos?csf=1&web=1&e=RCfxcC) |
|  | Have a look at the company repo. Are there any branches that need to be closed off, pull requests that need to be reviewed or actioned. Make a list and start working through them. | [Chameleon Project Repo](https://github.com/Chameleon-company) |
|  | Have a look at Trello, and ensure the Leadership team all have access to ALL boards, not just their board. | [Chameleon Trello Board(s)](https://trello.com/w/61f33f1ba01de01d88dd1509) |
|  | Get familiar with the state of each project by looking at the **Handover documents** from the last trimester. | [Handover Documents](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/Chameleon-Documents/tree/master/Chameleon%20Handover%20Documents) |
|  | **Environments** Set up your project environments and find issues early. Reach out to prior team leads to assist with major problems. The specific project information should be in Chameleon project folders. Check your access, can you login to everything. Get this solved now!! |  |
|  | **Find your seniors!** Check the handover documents, and look for the juniors. Contact them and see if they are coming back to Chameleon, pay attention to those that were in leadership roles. Look at the **Leadership minutes** to find the engaged students. | [Minutes](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Chameleon2-Chameleon-Leadership/Shared%20Documents/Chameleon-%20Leadership/Meetings?csf=1&web=1&e=4B92DO) |

|  | Create a spreadsheet for the Board (the leadership, aka you) to start tracking incoming students. What are their skills, what projects have they expressed interest in, who are the potential broader leadership team. |  |

Make an announcement in Chameleon general pointing to this document, and send all new members here. | [Onboarding Checklist](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/Chameleon-Documents/blob/462c0459425ae67e6b269beed852d6089962d7f2/Chameleon%20Policies%20and%20Guides/New%20Member%20Onboarding%20Checklist.md) |
